# Project 2 - *Wordle Pt. 2*

Submitted by: **Isaac Lara**

**Wordle Pt. 2** is a continuation form CodePaths IOS week one project. 
In this part we added a settings menu that let us change the themm, number of tires and how long the word is. 
I also implemented the alien word that changes the word everytime the player gets the word wrong. 

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- [x] User can change the numbers of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- [x] User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- [x] User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] App displays a reset button on the top left to reset the game (but make no changes to the settings)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
